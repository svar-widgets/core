[SVAR Core library](https://svar.dev/svelte/core/) offers a set of 20+ ready-made Svelte UI components: form controls, popups, date and time picker, toast notifications, and more.
All components are lightweight, responsive, fast-performing, and available in light and dark skins.

In addition to the Core library, you can use the following SVAR components to build unified app UIs:

-   [Menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wx-svelte-menu)
-   [Toolbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wx-svelte-toolbar)
-   [File uploader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wx-svelte-uploader)

### Svelte 4 and Svelte 5 versions

There are two versions of the library: the 1.x version, designed to work with Svelte 4, and the 2.x version, created for Svelte 5. Please note that the 2.x version is in beta and may contain some instabilities.

To use the SVAR Core beta for Svelte 5, install it as follows:

```
npm install wx-svelte-core
```

To use the SVAR Core for Svelte 4:

```
npm install wx-svelte-core@1.3.0
```

# :hammer_and_wrench: How to Use

To use any of the Core components, simply import the package and include the desired component in your Svelte file:

```svelte
<script>
	import { Button } from "wx-svelte-core";
</script>

<Button>Click me</Button>
```

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.svar.dev/svelte/core/getting_started/) to quickly set up and begin using SVAR Core components in your Svelte projects.

### :computer: How to Modify

Typically, you don't need to modify the code. However, if you wish to do so, follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Note that this project is a monorepo using `yarn` workspaces, so npm will not work
2. Start the project in development mode with `yarn start`

### :white_check_mark: Run Tests

To run the test:

1. Start the test examples with:
    ```sh
    yarn start:tests
    ```
2. In a separate console, run the end-to-end tests with:
    ```sh
    yarn test:cypress
    ```
